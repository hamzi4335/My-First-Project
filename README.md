# This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python.

The user is prompted to enter a move: "Rock", "Papar" (should be "Paper"), or "Scissor".

The computer randomly selects a move from the same options.

The game then compares both choices and displays the result: win, lose, or tie.
